**Electron counting in Electron Microscopy (EM) using back-propagation.**

This repository provides tools for electron counting in pixelated silicon detectors, such as those used in 4D-STEM experiments. The core method uses a pre-defined Gaussian kernel and back-propagation, implemented in PyTorch, to identify individual electron strikes.
